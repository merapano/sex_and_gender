                   Third Edition is a sophisticated synthesis of social
                   and cultural anthropology. Keesing was concerned with
                   the political and ethical implications of
                   anthropological fieldwork and was sensitive to the
                   global conditions of inequality caused by the spread
                   of capitalist relations of production. Thus, his book
                   is more "political" than other introductory texts in
                   the field. Keesing was also committed to the belief
                   that students should not merely memorize terms and
                   theories, but should also be challenged to ponder the
                   deep questions raised by human diversity. Roger
                   Keesing's untimely death in 1992 necessitated that a
                   co-author execute his planned revision. Dr. Andrew
                   Strathern was chosen because, like Keesing, his
                   training is in the British social anthropological
                   tradition, his fieldwork has concentrated on the
                   Pacific, and his recent teaching experience has
                   acquainted him with American cultural anthropology.
                   In this revision, Dr. Strathern preserved Keesing's
                   vision, arguments, and the ethnographies presented as
                   illustrations of Keesing's theories, while also
                   examining each sentence to determine whether its
                   assertions needed to be updated, modified, or
                   abandoned. Small changes made in this way
                   incorporated a larger aim of updating and recasting
                   the book to better fit and reflect a world 20 years
                   since publication of the first edition.},
